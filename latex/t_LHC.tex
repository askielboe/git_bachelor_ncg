\subsection{Experimental high energy physics at LHC}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the worlds higest-energy and also largest particle accelerator. It is designed for hadron-hadron collissions with each beam having an energy of 7 TeV. LHC has four intersection points and the detectors at these points are respectively ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHC-b. ATLAS and CMS are tho ones wich will look for the Higgs boson and new physics like extra dimensions, the nature of dark matter, Super Symmertry and maby NCG. 

\subsubsection{Luminosity}
The luminosity is a measurement of the number of collisions that can be produced in a detector per cm$^{2}$ and per second. It is given by:

\begin{equation}
L=n\frac{N_{1}N_{2}}{A}f
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the number of colliding bunches, $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the number of particles in each bunch, $A$ is the cross sectional area of the beam and $f$ is the frequency of the beam. Therefore L quantifies the intensity of the beams and tells us how many number of events the collider can produce at a given time. LCH is initially set to startup with a luminosity of 10 fb$^{-1}$ in a year.

\subsubsection{Cross section}
The cross section is a measure of the probability of a given process occurring in the accelerator. So, larger cross-sections mean that a process is more likely to occur. Cross-sections are measured in barns.

\subsubsection{Parton Distribution Funktion, PDF}
During the collision between two protons, the proton will dissasociate into a virtual state of u and d quarks, gluons and a "sea" of quark and antiquark called partons. With very high collision energy, we can ignore the quantum effect and the partons can be considered to be free. Therefore, the partons scatter incoherently and the proton cross section is simply the sum of the individual parton cross sections. This is a classical probability distribution function, given by $f_{i}(x)$, where $i$ refers to the different types of the partons and $x$ is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the parton\cite{green2005hpp}. $f_{i}(x)$ is therefore the probability distribution to find a parton with momentum fraction $x$.
