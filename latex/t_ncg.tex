\subsection{Non-commutative Geometry}
One candidate theory that tries to solve the problem of getting gravity incorporated into the SM is non commutative geometry (NCG). NCG is a mathematical description of space-time that can be interpreted as giving each point in space-time a spatial extension, as opposed to GR where each point is infinitely localized. In ordinary QFT position operators commute, $[ \hat x^{\mu}, \hat x^{\nu}] = 0$, this means that you can swap the positions without changing the state of the system. The idea that coordinates may not commute can be traced back to Heisenberg \cite{snyder1947qst}. Allain Connes \cite{connes1991pma} was the first to formulate a mathematical description of NCG. In 1990 he introduced a non-zero commutator between the position operators \cite{rosendahl2008};
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ncgtheta}
	[ \hat x^{\mu}, \hat x^{\nu}] = i \theta^{\mu \nu} = i \frac{1}{\Lambda_{\textrm{NCG}}^2} F^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ is a constant, real, antisymmetric tensor, $\Lambda_{\textrm{NCG}}$ is a scalar quantity which has the unit of energy and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is an antisymmetric tensor inspired by the classic electromagnetic field strength tensor.\footnote{See section 11.9 in \cite{jackson1975cew} on covariance and special relativity in electrodynamics.} The commutator, $\theta^{\mu \nu}$, can be understood as a background field not affecting free particles but only their interactions. Therefore the non-commutative Standard Model will keep the original gauge group and particle content \cite{rosendahl2008}.
%We will later, when calculating  choose to ignore the space direction dependence induced by the field strength tensor and make the approximation $\theta = 1/\Lambda_{\textrm{NCG}}^2$, where $\Lambda_{\textrm{NCG}}$ is a scalar quantity which has the unit of energy.

\subsubsection{The minimum length scale}
By introducing a non-zero commutator between position operators the uncertainty principle becomes
\begin{equation}
\Delta \hat x^{\mu} \Delta \hat x^{\nu} \ge \frac{\theta^{\mu \nu}}{2}.
\end{equation}
Remembering the analogue from QM where $\Delta x^{\mu} \Delta p^{\mu} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$, as precision in position increases, the precision in the momentum decreases accordingly. In the same way NCG defines a minimum length scale. Here the uncertainty of two positions conflate, and creates a minimum detectable area which is dependent on the magnitude of $\theta^{\mu \nu}$.

\subsubsection{New interactions}
The inclusion of non-commutative geometry into the standard model adds new terms to the SM Lagrangian. Specifically we want to look at a term which allows the $Z^0$ boson to interact with gluons, the mediators of the strong interaction. This amplitude is strictly zero in the ordinary SM, but in NCG we get a term in the Lagrangian which looks like \cite{melic2005smn}
\begin{align} \label{eq:zggterm}
	\mathcal{L}_{Zgg} = &\frac{e}{4}\sin{2\theta_W}\textrm{K}_{Zgg}\theta^{\rho\sigma}
	[2 Z^{\mu\nu} (2 G_{\mu\rho}^a G_{\nu\sigma}^b - G_{\mu\nu}^a G_{\rho\sigma}^b) \nonumber \\
	 &+ 8 Z_{\mu\rho} G^{\mu\nu,a} G_{\nu\sigma}^b - Z_{\rho\sigma} G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{\mu\nu,b}
	] \delta^{ab},
\end{align}

where $K_{Zgg}$ is a dimensionless constant in the region $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ \cite{behr2003dnc}, $\theta_W$ is the Weinberg angle and $\theta^{\rho\sigma}$ is given in \eqref{eq:ncgtheta}. Using this term one can derive the corresponding feynman rules, arriving at a non-zero amplitude for processes including $Zgg$ vertices \cite{melic2005smn}. These vertices are of special interest because they are allowed for by on-shell propagators. This is in contrast to other NCG processes like $Z \rightarrow ZZ$ and $Z \rightarrow Z\gamma$, which are forbidden by kinematics, in the on-shell domain \cite{behr2003dnc}.
