\section{General relativity}
General Relativity (GR) is the theory describing
\\ \\
So far there have been no successful unification of the SM and General Relativity (GR), which is the theory describing all know macroscopic

\subsection{Spacetime}
Here be:
- Matter and energy defines coordinate systems (spacetime bending)
- Fields become non-conservative
- The path integral in GR

\subsection{Quantum gravity}
- Quantum fluctuations + dependance on path => infinities
- Non-renormalizability
- Theories (strings, NCG) tries to solve this by defining a minium lenght-scale
  to smear out quantum fluctuations in hope of making QG renormalizable.
