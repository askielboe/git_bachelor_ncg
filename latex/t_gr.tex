\subsection{General relativity}
You might have noticed that we have not mentioned gravity jet. The SM is only a theory describing the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, it says nothing about gravity. Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity, not by the concept of force, as Newton did, but as a property of the geometry of space and time. Given that space and time are related, measurements in space can be related to measurements in time by the speed of light. The resulting space-time is thought of as a smooth and continuous manifold. Gravity is the effect of the curvature of the space-time whenever matter is present.\\
Because of tidal forces between to bodies, the gravitaional effects is no longer conservative. Therefore the pathintegral is dependent on the path taken.\\

So far there have been no successful unification of the SM and GR.

\subsubsection{Spacetime}
Here be:
- Matter and energy defines coordinate systems (spacetime bending)
- Fields become non-conservative
- The path integral in GR

\subsubsection{Quantum gravity}
- Quantum fluctuations + dependance on path => infinities
- Non-renormalizability
- Theories (strings, NCG) tries to solve this by defining a minium lenght-scale
  to smear out quantum fluctuations in hope of making QG renormalizable.
