\section{Results}
In the following section we present our results, and numerical considerations, relevant for overviewing the possible consequences of NCG at modern collider experiments. An estimate on the possible scale of a NCG theory will be given, and we will see what impact this will have on cross sections for processes involving the $Z$ boson.

\subsection{Setting constraints on $\Lambda$ using LEP data}
To set a constraint on the possible values of $\Lambda^2$ we can look at the width of $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg}$ as predicted by NCG. Now, we have not seen effects of NCG greater than the uncertainty in current experimental data, additional contribution to the total $Z^0$ width, coming from $Z \rightarrow gg$ processes, must thus be lower than the current uncertainty $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} < 1 \times 10^{-3}$ GeV \cite{behr2003dnc}. To see how this puts a constraint on $\theta$ we use an expression for $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg}$ taken from \cite{behr2003dnc};
\begin{equation} \label{eq:zggwidth}
	\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} = \frac{8}{12} K_{gg}^2 \alpha M_Z^5 \sin^22\theta_W \frac{1}{\Lambda^4}.
\end{equation}
In figure \ref{fig:kplot} we have made a plot of the minimum allowed value for $\Lambda$. Allowed values of $K_{gg}$ lies in the interval $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ \cite{behr2003dnc}, so our maximum lower bound for $\Lambda$ is found for $K_{gg}=0.2$. This gives the experimental minimal value $\Lambda >117$ GeV.
\includefigure{fig:kplot}{0.3}{./images/kplot}{Plot of the allowed region for $\Lambda$ and $K_{gg}$. The filled area represent the constraint $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} < 0.001 \textrm{ GeV}$ as set by equation \eqref{eq:zggwidth}. Allowed $K_{gg}$ is in the region $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ represented by the black box in the figure.}

\subsection{Cross sections for different $\Lambda$ compared to SM}
Below we have drawn histograms showing the expected number of event at LHC (with $L=10 \textrm{ fb}^{-1}$) from colliding protons, producing muon-pairs through leading order diagrams (Figures \ref{fig:feyn:parton_qq} and \ref{fig:feyn:parton_gg}) of the process $pp \rightarrow Z \rightarrow \mu \bar \mu$, together with the contribution as predicted by NCG. All interference terms have been ignored. As have contributions from diagrams involving vertices $\gamma gg$. Four different plots are made for different values of $\Lambda$. The statistical error, $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of events in the given bin, is shown by the gray band for the ordinary SM data only.
