\section{Results}
In the following section we present our results, and numerical considerations, relevant for overviewing the possible consequences of NCG at modern collider experiments. An estimate on the possible scale of a NCG theory will be given, and we will see what impact this will have on cross sections for processes involving the $Z$ boson.

\subsection{Setting a lower limit on $\Lambda$ using LEP data}
To set a constraint on the possible values of $\Lambda$ we can look at the width of $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg}$ predicted by NCG. As we have not seen effects of NCG greater than the uncertainty in current experimental data, additional contribution to the total $Z^0$ width, coming from $Z \rightarrow gg$ processes, must thus be lower than the uncertainty $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} < 1 \times 10^{-3}$ GeV.\footnote{This uncertainty is taken from \cite{behr2003dnc}.} To get a 95\% one-sided confidence limit (CL) we multiply this number by $1.64$ \cite{amsler2008rpp} yielding $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} < 1.64 \times 10^{-3}$ GeV. To see how this puts a constraint on $\Lambda$ we use an expression for $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg}$ taken from \cite{behr2003dnc};
\begin{equation} \label{eq:zggwidth}
	\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} = \frac{8}{12} K_{gg}^2 \alpha M_Z^5 \sin^22\theta_W \frac{1}{\Lambda^4}.
\end{equation}
In figure \ref{fig:kplot} we have made a plot of the minimum allowed value for $\Lambda$. Allowed values of $K_{gg}$ lies in the interval $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ \cite{behr2003dnc}. Since the width $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg}$ depends on a product of $K_{gg}$ and $\Lambda$ we can't fix both values by experiment. Instead we assume a maximum coupling scenario, in which $K_{gg}=0.2$. The allowed values for $\Lambda$ are then found to be $\Lambda >117$ GeV. This is the best limit we can set on $\Lambda$ with data from LEP.

The filled area represent the constraint $\Gamma_{Z \rightarrow gg} < 1.64 \times 10^{-3}$ GeV as set by equation \eqref{eq:zggwidth}. Allowed $K_{gg}$ is in the region $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ represented by the black horizontal line. The vertical line shows the minimum value of $\Lambda$ for the maximum-interaction scenario, $K_{gg} = 0.2$.}

\subsection{Setting a constraint on $\Lambda$ using the LHC}
The possibility for us to put a sensible limit on $\Lambda$ at LHC depends to a great degree on the sensitivity of the experiments. First of all we assume that the detector is perfect, in the sense that it records and identifies all our events.\footnote{Another way to put this is to say that the detector acceptance is equal to unity so that the number of detected event is equal to the actual number of events happening, $N = A\sigma \mathcal{L} = \sigma \mathcal{L}$, where $A$ is the acceptance.} Secondly we assume that the precision in the experiment can be approximated by a usual gaussian error with respect to the expected number of events. This gives an error of $\pm \sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of events. We will continue to use this approximation even for low $N$, even though data then may not be truly gaussian in this area. To achieve a CL of 95\% from only one tail of the distribution we multiply the error by $1.64$ yielding $\sigma = 1.64 \sqrt{N}$.\footnote{See p. 235 in \cite{hagiwara2002rpp}.}

We have made histograms showing the expected number of muon-pair production events at LHC with integrated luminosity of $10 \textrm{ fb}^{-1}$ running for 1 year.\footnote{To get from cross section to $N$ we simply multiply the histograms by $10^4$ fb $\cdot$ pb$^{-1}$.} The distributions are made using leading order diagrams in CompHEP (Figures \ref{fig:feyn:parton_qq} and \ref{fig:feyn:parton_gg}) for the process $pp \rightarrow Z \rightarrow \mu \bar \mu$. All interference terms have been ignored. As have contributions from diagrams involving vertices $\gamma gg$. Four different plots are made for different values of $\Lambda$. The statistical error, $1.64\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of events in the given bin, is shown by the gray band for the ordinary SM data. Cross sections with contributions from NCG are shown as a blue line. Note that we have made all plots up to an energy of $\sqrt{s} \sim 1800$ GeV, even though we made an approximation, in the zero-range interaction scheme, valid only for $\sqrt{s} \ll \Lambda$.\footnote{See the derivation in section \ref{sec:derivcrosssection}.} In the complete description we would naturally observe a peak in the NCG cross section around the value of $\Lambda$, in analogy to the $Z$. Our approximation ignores this behavior completely and instead we obtain an extrapolation of the low energy behavior for $\sqrt{s} \ll \Lambda$. This extrapolation can still be instructive to look at even for high energies where our approximation no longer holds.

Assuming that NCG holds true and for $\Lambda < 900$ GeV we should be able to detect a significant increase in the number of events (CL > 95\%). For $\Lambda > 900$ GeV the additional events coming from NCG vertices are lost due statistical uncertainty in the data.
