When making predictions in quantum mechanics we make use of the path integral formalism formulated by Richard Feynman in 1948 [CITATION]. The path integral formalism takes in to account all possible paths that a particle, or another quantum mechanical system, going from a state $|i>$ to a state $|f>$ can take. This can be changes in position, momentum, energy or other intrinsic variables. Generally though, and this is actually a central point in quantum mechanics, and one that cannot be taken lightly, we are not interested in the path taken, but only in the fact that at some time $t_{i}$ the particle was in a state $|i>$ and at some later time $t_{f}$ the particle is in a state $|f>$. In order to arrive at this quantum probability-amplitude we must sum, or integrate, over  the infinitely many paths, that the system can take to go from  initial to final state. The amplitude is given as [CITATION]

\begin{equation}
	\left \langle f \right | U(t_f,t_i) \left | i \right \rangle = \mathcal{N} \int \mathcal{D}x e^{i\mathcal{S}},
\end{equation}

where $U$ is the time translation operator, $\mathcal{D}$ is an abbreviation given by the relation 

\begin{equation}
	\int \mathcal{D} x \equiv \lim_{N \to \infty} \int dx_1 \dots dx_N
\end{equation}

and the action $\mathcal{S}$ is related to the Lagrangian by the action principle

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{S} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} L(\dot{x},x)dt.
\end{equation}
