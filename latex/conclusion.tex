\section{Conclusion}
Hopefully LHC will start up this summer and within a few years reach the maximum energy. The maximum energy present is reached by the Tevatron and is 2 TeV. As mentioned earlier LHC will reach 14 TeV and this alone is a quantum leap for the power of physical predictions. This will maybe cause a revolution in our way of understand high energy physics. One of the major problems of the SM that LHC can help to solve is the incompatibility with GR. Maybe LHC can give some hints in which direction we shall think. In this bachelors project we have worked with Non-commutative geometry, one of the candidates to solve the problem. It have mostly been a literarily study of the not so familiar subject, and we have, step by step, builded a fundament of understanding how QFT, GR, SM, CompHEP and ROOT works near a physicists. This is not always an easy job. Actually we are in the middle in every sense. In our education, in a course about experimental high energy physics and in the proceeding with LHC at CERN. As we every week gain more knowledge, our level of understanding changes. This makes it difficult to feel like having an overview and sometimes we feel a sudden urge to add all our updated informations. \\


We have found by using the uncertainty on the LEP measure of the total $Z^0$ width, that the coupling constant, $K_{gg}$, should be in the region $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ and this implied that $\Lambda_NG$ should be larger than 130 GeV, otherwise we would have seen this contribution already, see figure \ref{fig:kplot}. A general feature of new interactions is an increase in the total cross section. As we can se in \ref{fig:lambdaplot}


%comment to the plots 27/5/09 21:45:
the contribution from the new interaction $gg \rightarrow Z$ is far to huge, if this was nature we would have seen NCG long time ago. This could unfortunately be a seriously implementation of the nonexistence of NCG.(-deeply sigh!)\\

What if we actually see a much larger Z cross section at high energy levels? Can we then confirm NCG or could there be other (new) explanations?
