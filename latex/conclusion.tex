\section{Conclusion}
Hopefully LHC will start up this summer and within a few years reach the maximum energy of 14 TeV. The maximum energy currently available is at the Tevatron, and that is only running 2 TeV. The LHC is designed to reach energies of up to 14 TeV, this is a quantum leap in the power available to particle physicists, and may produce results that can cause a revolution in our way of understand high energy physics. In either case, LHC may be able to give us a hint as to which direction we shall think. In our bachelor project we have worked with Non-commutative geometry, one of the many proposed extensions to the SM. It have mostly been a literarily study of the not so familiar subject, and we have, step by step, builded a fundament of understanding how QFT, GR, SM, CompHEP and ROOT works near a physicists. This is not always an easy job. Actually we are in the middle in every sense. In our education, in a course about experimental high energy physics and in the proceeding with LHC at CERN. As we every week gain more knowledge, our level of understanding changes. This makes it difficult to feel like having an overview and sometimes we feel a sudden urge to add all our updated informations.\\


We have found, by using the uncertainty on the LEP measure of the total $Z^0$ width, that the coupling constant, $K_{gg}$, should be in the region $\{-0.1,0.2\}$ and this implied that $\Lambda_NG$ should be larger than 117 GeV, otherwise we would have seen this contribution already, see figure \ref{fig:kplot}. A general feature of new interactions is an increase in the total cross section. As we can se in \ref{fig:lambdaplot}


%comment to the plots 27/5/09 21:45:
the contribution from the new interaction $gg \rightarrow Z$ is far to huge, if this was nature we would have seen NCG long time ago. This could unfortunately be a seriously implementation of the nonexistence of NCG.(-deeply sigh!)\\

What if we actually see a much larger Z cross section at high energy levels? Can we then confirm NCG or could there be other (new) explanations?
